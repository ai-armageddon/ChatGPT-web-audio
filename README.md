# ChatGPT-web-audio

A Chrome extension that supercharges ChatGPT's Read Aloud feature with a beautiful floating media controller and one-click access.

## Features

- **One-Click Access** - Speaker button injected into assistant responses with readable text (no more digging through menus!)
- **Floating Media Controller** - Sleek, draggable panel with full playback controls
- **Smart Audio Hijacking** - Intercepts OpenAI's native audio stream for seamless control
- **Playback Speed Control** - Click the speed pill to cycle 1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, or 2x (persists across sessions)
- **Position Memory** - Panel remembers where you dragged it (even after page reload)
- **Modern UI** - Clean, glassmorphic design that follows ChatGPT's light/dark theme
- **Auto-Hide** - Panel only appears when audio is playing, hides when finished

## Screenshots

### Injected Speaker Button
A native-looking speaker button appears as the first item in assistant response action rows when Read Aloud is available. Image-only responses do not show it.

## Installation

### Method 1: Chrome Web Store (Coming Soon)
*Will be available on the Chrome Web Store once published*

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Download this repository as a ZIP file
2. Extract the ZIP to a folder (e.g., `ChatGPT-web-audio`)
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
4. Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in top-right)
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder
6. Navigate to `https://chatgpt.com` and enjoy!

## Usage

1. **Play Audio** - Click the speaker button under any text-based ChatGPT response
2. **Control Playback** - Use the floating panel to play/pause, skip, or seek
3. **Adjust Speed** - Click the speed pill to cycle through playback speeds
4. **Reposition Panel** - Drag the panel by its header to your preferred location
5. **Hide Panel** - Click the × button or let it auto-hide when audio ends

## Technical Details

### How It Works
- **Button Injection**: Uses `MutationObserver` to detect new messages and inject speaker buttons
- **Audio Hijacking**: Intercepts OpenAI's native `<audio>` elements and routes control to custom UI
- **Detached Audio Support**: Patches `HTMLMediaElement.play()` to capture audio objects that never enter the DOM
- **Storage**: Uses `chrome.storage.local` to persist speed preferences and panel position
- **Pointer Events**: Emulates real user interactions for compatibility with ChatGPT's Radix UI components

### Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3)
- ✅ ChatGPT (chatgpt.com)
- ✅ All OpenAI voice models
- ✅ Desktop and laptop browsers

### Versioning
The version in `manifest.json` follows the commit count: the minor number goes up by one every 3 commits, and the patch number counts the commits in between (commit 15 is `0.5.0`, commit 16 is `0.5.1`). Run `node version.js` before committing to set it.

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Playing
- **Check Console**: Open DevTools (F12) and look for errors
- **Refresh Page**: Sometimes ChatGPT's UI changes require a page reload
- **Disable Conflicts**: Try disabling other ChatGPT extensions temporarily

### Button Not Appearing
- **Wait for Load**: Give the page a moment to fully load
- **Check Messages**: Only assistant messages have the speaker button
- **Refresh**: Try refreshing the page if buttons don't appear

### Panel Not Showing
- **Start Audio**: The panel only appears when audio is actively playing
- **Check Position**: The panel might be off-screen - drag it back into view

### Extension Not Loading
- **Verify Installation**: Ensure the extension is enabled in `chrome://extensions`
- **Check Permissions**: Make sure it has access to `chatgpt.com`
- **Reload Extension**: Click the reload button in `chrome://extensions`
